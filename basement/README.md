1. New upstairs counter and sink in craft room (temporary kitchen area)

Phase 5
1. Downstairs Kichen - cabinets, sink, oven, freezer unit
1. Kitchen and craft room vents
1. Grate over HVAC units
1. Rear barbecue grill stone enclosure
1. Tiles laid out for rain absorption as back porch (small)
1. Rain barrels and pipe hookup under south steps

Phase 6
1. Move existing front stairway (small)
1. Upstairs tub, move sink, new toilet
1. Add downstairs shower under stairway

Phase 7 (optional)
1. Light well using elevator shaft
1. Basement chiller and elevator shaft duct
1. Elevator

Several projects indicated as small may be done by Loren, dependent on cost.

# Basement

### Zero Emission Concrete

Atlanta-based Thomas Concrete has been using the Canadian CarbonCure system since 2016.
[CNN Article](https://money.cnn.com/2018/06/12/technology/concrete-carboncure/index.html)  

"CarbonCure involves injecting carbon dioxide captured from various other industrial processes into concrete during the mixing process. A chemical reaction would “mineralize” that carbon dioxide, which would have the added benefit of making the concrete compressively stronger." “We have seen no downsides to using CarbonCure,”  Drew Millwood, the Thomas Concrete technician who oversaw the Kendeda job, writes: “It allows for cement reduction in any mix it is used in and provides strength at or above design. No cost increase is involved in a mix containing CO2 as the savings from cement reduction offset the cost of CO2 delivery. Equipment costs are easily recouped due to the savings.” - [source](https://livingbuilding.kendedafund.org/2019/07/16/carboncure/)  

## Coreslab

### Hollow Core

Heat-sink in the main floor coreslab stores solar energy to radiat out at night.  

8” slab + 2” concrete topping. 10” total.

### Precast Concrete

### Concrete with Cellulose Nanocrystals

Cellulose nanocrystals provide an avenue for water to hydrate cement particles when mixing.  

Cellulose-infused concrete is stronger and sets faster

### Radiant pumping, chiller and air-handling unit.
<!--A means to avoid duct work applied at the Kendeda Living Building.  -->

Our central elevator shaft will allow chilled air to fall from an attic AC unit.  
A small AC unit will also reside within south porch ceiling.  
Two existing HVAC units will reside under grate on north side of house.  
Chiller in basement will pump cold air up a duct within elevator shaft.
