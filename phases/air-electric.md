## AC Units, Grey Water Storage

### 5 sources of cold air
<!--A means to avoid duct work applied at the Kendeda Living Building.  -->

The home's two existing HVAC units will reside under a grate on the north side of the house. 

An attic AC unit will connect to ducts and the central elevator shaft.

A small AC unit will also reside within the ceiling of the south facing porch.  
 
Chiller/freezer unit in the basement will pump cold air up a duct within the elevator shaft.  
<!-- Radiant pumping, chiller and air-handling unit. -->

Plans do not yet include location for “influx of fresh air” to stimulate building temperatures. Probably need to run through a dehumidifier.  

### HVAC Duct Fabricators
Atlanta Supply - Logan Circle (for Ducts, custom)  
Custom sheet metal (pricey) [B & S Sheet Metal Fabricators Inc.](https://bsmetalfabricators.com/)  

Current HVAC in crawl space: Ducane  
Sept 2014 - Circuit board replaced  
Motor did not need to be replaced (m#FPBB100A5 S#20251005A PRODUCT#1006559993) 

For future - Go with the 4 inch filter tray for better airflow (.12) and filtration (97%):  

Allergen Deep Pleat 1550 (4")  
3-10 microns 97%  
MERV 12  
pressure drop .12  

Not quite as good (but the best airflow for the 1" filters we currently use):  
Ultra Allergen 1500  
310 microns - 90%  
MERV 12  
pressure drop .15  


<h2>West Elevation</h2><br>
Cold air enters at upper left AC.  
Hot air generated in the basement, lower left. Air loops through concrete slabs as heat-sink while solar operational.
