# Basement Details

## Low Carbon Emission Concrete

Atlanta-based Thomas Concrete has been using the Canadian CarbonCure system since 2016.
[CNN Article](https://money.cnn.com/2018/06/12/technology/concrete-carboncure/index.html)  

"CarbonCure involves injecting carbon dioxide captured from various other industrial processes into concrete during the mixing process. A chemical reaction would “mineralize” that carbon dioxide, which would have the added benefit of making the concrete compressively stronger." “We have seen no downsides to using CarbonCure,”  Drew Millwood, the Thomas Concrete technician who oversaw the Kendeda job, writes: “It allows for cement reduction in any mix it is used in and provides strength at or above design. No cost increase is involved in a mix containing CO2 as the savings from cement reduction offset the cost of CO2 delivery. Equipment costs are easily recouped due to the savings.” - [source](https://livingbuilding.kendedafund.org/2019/07/16/carboncure/)  

## Hollow Core Concrete Slabs

<!--
<a href="../phases/img/coreslab.jpg"><img src="../phases/img/coreslab.jpg" style="width:100%; max-width:1200px"></a>  
<br>
-->
8” slab + 2” concrete topping. 10” total.  

Hollow Core slabs could provide a heat-sink in the main floor, storing heat generated from solar energy to radiate out at night.  Likely to use electric on basement floor to heat basement ceiling slab from below.

### Concrete with Cellulose Nanocrystals

Cellulose nanocrystals provide an avenue for water to hydrate cement particles when mixing.  

Cellulose-infused concrete is stronger and sets faster

## Repointing Bricks

## Porch Railing Style

Not our house. For reference only...  

<a href="../exterior/img/porch.jpg"><img src="../exterior/img/porch.jpg" style="width:100%; max-width:1200px"></a> 

Waterflow at porch - Six levels of drain protection:

1. Area above stairs drains into pipe that outputs below porch.  
2. Downspout drains into three rain barrels within west side of porch, then outputs below porch.  
3. Sidewalk higher than stairs drains to outflow below porch below.  
4. Sidewalk lower than stairs has a drain before doorway.  Addition to sidewalk angles away from door.  
5. Goove below doors drains below porch.  
6. Interior floor angles away from deeper basement, which has a sump pump.
