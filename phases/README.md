# Basement Details

## Low Carbon Emission Concrete

Atlanta-based Thomas Concrete has been using the Canadian CarbonCure system since 2016.
[CNN Article](https://money.cnn.com/2018/06/12/technology/concrete-carboncure/index.html)  

"CarbonCure involves injecting carbon dioxide captured from various other industrial processes into concrete during the mixing process. A chemical reaction would “mineralize” that carbon dioxide, which would have the added benefit of making the concrete compressively stronger." “We have seen no downsides to using CarbonCure,”  Drew Millwood, the Thomas Concrete technician who oversaw the Kendeda job, writes: “It allows for cement reduction in any mix it is used in and provides strength at or above design. No cost increase is involved in a mix containing CO2 as the savings from cement reduction offset the cost of CO2 delivery. Equipment costs are easily recouped due to the savings.” - [source](https://livingbuilding.kendedafund.org/2019/07/16/carboncure/)  

## Hollow Core Concrete Slabs

<a href="../phases/img/coreslab.jpg"><img src="../phases/img/coreslab.jpg" style="width:100%; max-width:1200px"></a>  
<br>

Hollow Core slabs will provide a heat-sink in the main floor, storing heat generated from solar energy to radiate out at night.  

8” slab + 2” concrete topping. 10” total.  

 2” Acid Wash Cement cover (Structural, composite concrete topping)

Air flow leaves the electric heating unit on the right side, move though hollow core basement ceiling, and return for reheating via the left duct.<br><br><br>


<a href="../phases/img/coreslab/coreslab-south.jpg"><img src="../phases/img/coreslab/coreslab-south.jpg" style="width:100%; max-width:1200px"></a><br><br>
U-shaped pipes would connect sets of two pipes to create ten 50 foot loops. Air circulating through slabs would not be mixed with home air.

### Concrete with Cellulose Nanocrystals

Cellulose nanocrystals provide an avenue for water to hydrate cement particles when mixing.  

Cellulose-infused concrete is stronger and sets faster

## Exterior Fireplace
The fireplace will convert from a range to a pit for burning wood.
<br><br>
<a href="../exterior/img/fireplace/fireplace.jpg"><img src="../exterior/img/fireplace/fireplace.jpg" style="width:100%; max-width:1200px"></a><br><br>

Enclosed air tubes in the top of fireplace will connect to the basement loop to circulate heat into floor slabs.  
The tube will snake through the top of the fireplace, so air with ashes is not mixing with the house loop.
<br><br>

## AC Units, Grey Water Storage

### 5 sources of cold air
<!--A means to avoid duct work applied at the Kendeda Living Building.  -->

The home's two existing HVAC units will reside under a grate on the north side of the house. 

An attic AC unit will connect to ducts and the central elevator shaft.

A small AC unit will also reside within the ceiling of the south facing porch.  
 
Chiller/freezer unit in the basement will pump cold air up a duct within the elevator shaft.  
<!-- Radiant pumping, chiller and air-handling unit. -->
