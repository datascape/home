### Low Carbon Emission Concrete

Atlanta-based Thomas Concrete has been using the Canadian CarbonCure system since 2016.
[CNN Article](https://money.cnn.com/2018/06/12/technology/concrete-carboncure/index.html)  

"CarbonCure involves injecting carbon dioxide captured from various other industrial processes into concrete during the mixing process. A chemical reaction would “mineralize” that carbon dioxide, which would have the added benefit of making the concrete compressively stronger." “We have seen no downsides to using CarbonCure,”  Drew Millwood, the Thomas Concrete technician who oversaw the Kendeda job, writes: “It allows for cement reduction in any mix it is used in and provides strength at or above design. No cost increase is involved in a mix containing CO2 as the savings from cement reduction offset the cost of CO2 delivery. Equipment costs are easily recouped due to the savings.” - [source](https://livingbuilding.kendedafund.org/2019/07/16/carboncure/)  

## Hollow Core concrete slabs

<a href="../phases/img/coreslab.jpg"><img src="../phases/img/coreslab.jpg" style="width:100%; max-width:1200px"></a>  
<br>

Hollow Ccre slabs will provide a heat-sink in the main floor, storing heat generated from solar energy to radiate out at night.  

8” slab + 2” concrete topping. 10” total.  

 2” Acid Wash Cement cover (Structural, composite concrete topping)

Not that external air is NOT sent through the hollow core slab. Air would move in a loop.

<a href="../phases/img/coreslab/coreslab-ducts.jpg"><img src="../phases/img/coreslab/coreslab-ducts.jpg" style="width:100%; max-width:1200px"></a><br><br>
Air would leave the electric heating unit on the right side, move though one of ten 50 foot loops in the hollow core basement ceiling, and return for reheating via the left duct.<br><br><br>

### Concrete with Cellulose Nanocrystals

Cellulose nanocrystals provide an avenue for water to hydrate cement particles when mixing.  

Cellulose-infused concrete is stronger and sets faster

## AC Units, Grey Water Storage

### 5 sources of cold air
<!--A means to avoid duct work applied at the Kendeda Living Building.  -->

The home's two existing HVAC units will reside under grate on north side of house. 

An attic AC unit will connect to ducts and central elevator shaft.

A small AC unit will also reside within south porch ceiling.  
 
Chiller in basement will pump cold air up a duct within elevator shaft.  
<!-- Radiant pumping, chiller and air-handling unit. -->
