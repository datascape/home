## A passive home addition

Wrapped in extra insulation, from floor to roof  
Triple pane windows that should feel just as warm to the touch as the walls

## Mini Split - Heating and Cooling

Two outside units on the north side serving 3 or 4 units. 

- 45 feet to the wall by south porch.  
- the downstairs kitchen above cabinets. 
- the master bedroom wall above sliding bathroom door.

Air movement volumes delivered by a mini-split give no advantage to putting near floor, unless maybe you have a vented crawlspace.  Subsequently we should insulate kitchen floor.

## STEP Warmfloor

STEP Warmfloor gives 2.5 times more heat output than cable systems, 2.08 times more heat output than hydronic systems, and up to 60% more efficient than conventional forced air systems.

It can be placed under wood to create our gym-livingroom floor, rather than pouring more concrete on the hollow core slabs for hydronics. A thermal barrier between the slab and the element adds efficiency. Seems good for the basement floor too.

- Rolled cork
- Cerazorb
- Healthy Choice sound solution pad

## Tankless Booster


## Grey Water

2 grey water tanks in the new attic area are for BOTH toilet flushing and watering the yard.  The the 3 "rain barrel" tanks below the porch feed into the 2 attic tanks.

Perhaps is generated during drip irrigation on cloudy days by turning a small turbine with the descending water.  Turbine is turned off when higher pressure is used to water lawn, or entire yard uses drip. 2 antique tanks within the backside of the fireplace hold additional water.
